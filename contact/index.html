<p>If any of my work interests you or you have an opportunity/project you think I'd be interested in, there are a number of ways you can get in touch. The easiest and fastest way is of course email, but I've listed other methods here should you prefer them:</p>

<h2>Email:</h2>
<p>I can be reached at<a href="mailto:p.j.swatton@essex.ac.uk">p.j.swatton@essex.ac.uk</a>. Please note however that it may take a couple of working days for me to get back to you.</p>

<h2>Social Media:</h2>
<p>I can be found on several social media sites, but the main ones that at least somewhat relate to my work are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_swatton">@phil_swatton</a></li>
  <li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philswatton/">Phil Swatton</a></li>
