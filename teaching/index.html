<p>At present, I am a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant at UCL. I teach on the QStep program for UCL, which while hosted in the Deparmtent of Political Science also covers students doing Social Science and Quantitative Methods, Geography, or Population Health degrees. In the first semester, I taught seminars Principles of Social Science Research (a mix of philosophy of social science and causal inference/experiment design) and this semester I am teaching seminars for Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods, where my primary role is teaching students how to use R.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant in the Essex Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis on a course on webscraping and data management. At present I don't plan to seek out teaching work in the 3rd year of my PhD outside of short-term work such as that at the ESS. A list of my experience can be found below:</p>
