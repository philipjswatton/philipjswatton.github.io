<p>I'm currently in the process of applying for teaching positions, with a particular interest in teaching either quantitative research methods or public opinion (or even better, some combination of both). I have one piece of teaching experience in academia which was a course on webscraping and data management with R. You can find the details below.</p>

<h2>Past Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> to <a href="http://rochelleterman.com/">Rochelle Terman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rochelleterman/ESS-webscraping">3I: Web Scraping and Data Management in R</a>. Course ran from 10th August 2020 to 21st August 2020.</p>
