I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My supervisor is Rob Johns and my current supervisory board members are Paul Whiteley, and Roi Zur. Previous members of my supervisory board are Dominik Duell. Before my PhD, I earned a BA International Relations and Politics from Keele University (2015-2018) and an MSc Political Science (2018-2019) here at the University of Essex.

Broadly defined, my current interests are:
- Measurement of political beliefs
- Quantitative research methods
- Statistical programming
- Public opinion
- Party strategy

I am in the process of writing several papers in these areas, some of which belong to my PhD thesis. You can see the list of papers I am current working on [here](/publications).

At the time of writing, I also hold one Research Officer post here at Essex, on a research project for Filip Kostelka. I have also previously worked on a project for Royce Carroll and am set to begin working on a project for Roi Zur.

I'm also often in some teaching assistant position, always related in some form or other to the above areas of interest. I've previously taught for the Essex Summer School and UCL. The subjects I've taught include philosophy of social science, intro to causal inference, into to statistics, R progrmaming, webscraping, and measurement.
