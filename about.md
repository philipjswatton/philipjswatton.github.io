# About me

At the moment, I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. From October, I'll be starting at the Alan Turing Institute as a Data Scientist. My PhD thesis is titled 'Three Essays on the Measurement of Political Ideology'. Beyond my thesis, I've been involved in research projects in the realms of political methodology, public opinion, and comparative politics. You can check out a list of my work on my [research page](/research)<!--, or a description of my interests on my [interests page](/interests)-->. If you'd just like to get the full rundown on my skills and experience, you can check out one of my CVs:

In the course of my work I've also developed a passion for both R programming and more general programming. I also maintain a [projects page](/projects) on this website. I started developing an interest in general programming during the first lockdown when I learned how to write web code. By now I'm sufficiently proficient to have pursued several projects - including this website.

During my PhD I've spent a large amount of time teaching quantitative research methods and R programming. My teaching experience has primarily been at the Essex Summer School and UCL. The courses I've taught on have covered ground such as R programming, statistics, philosophy of science, causal inference, measurement, webscraping, and machine learning.

I also have professional experience in politics and have lecturered on political negotiation and rhetoric at the University of Suffolk.
