I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My supervisor is Rob Johns and my current supervisory board members are Roi Zur and Ryan Bakker. Previous members of my supervisory board are Dominik Duell and Paul Whiteley. Before my PhD, I earned a BA International Relations and Politics from Keele University (2015-2018) and an MSc Political Science (2018-2019) here at the University of Essex.

Broadly defined, my research and teaching interests are:
- Measurement
- Survey analysis
- R programming
- Public opinion
- Spatial models of vote choice

I'm in the process of writing several papers in these areas, some of which belong to my PhD thesis. You can see the list of papers I'm currently working on [here](/publications).

At the time of writing, I also hold three Research Assistant posts here at Essex. The first is on a research project for Filip Kostelka, the second is on a project for Royce Carroll, and the third is on a research project for Roi Zur.

I'm also often in some teaching assistant position, always related in some form or other to the above areas of interest. I've previously taught for the Essex Summer School and UCL. The subjects of the courses I've taught include philosophy of social science, intro to causal inference, into to statistics, R progrmaming, webscraping, and measurement.
