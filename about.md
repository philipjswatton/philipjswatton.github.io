## About me

I'm a Data Scientist in the Applied Research Centre for Defence and Security at the Alan Turing Institute. I work on research projects in and around deep learning, and produce technical reports and proof-of-concept code for our partners.

I have a background in political science and have a PhD from the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My PhD thesis is titled 'Three Essays on the Measurement of Political Ideology'. Beyond my thesis, I've been involved in research projects in the realms of political methodology, public opinion, and comparative politics.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, programming, and learning new things.

## My CV

Academic and industry positions have different priorities and norms for CVs. For that reason, I maintain two CVs for applying to different kinds of position. Feel free to read one or both:
