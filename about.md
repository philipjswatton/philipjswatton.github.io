# About me

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My research interests sit in the broad intersection of data science, political methodology, and comaprative politics. You can check out a list of my work on my [research page](/research), or a description of my interests on my [interests page](/interests). If you'd just like to get the full rundown on my skills and experience, you can check out one of my CVs:

In the course of my work I've also developed a passion for both R programming and more general programming. I also maintain a [projects page](/projects) on this website. I started developing an interest in general programming during the first lockdown when I learned how to write web code. By now I'm sufficiently proficient to have pursued several projects - including this website.

During my PhD I've spent a large amount of time teaching quantitative research methods and R programming. My teaching experience has primarily been at the Essex Summer School and UCL. The courses I've taught on have covered ground such as R programming, statistics, philosophy of science, causal inference, measurement, and webscraping.

I also have professional experience in politics and have lecturered on political negotiation and rhetoric at the University of Suffolk.
