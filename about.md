# About

Hi there! My name is Phil. I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My supervisor is Rob Johns and my board members are Dominik Duell and Paul Whiteley. My thesis is in the broad realms of public opinion and quanitative research methods. In particular, much of my research focuses on the second dimension of political beliefs, measurement methods for political beliefs, and quantiative research methods for public opinion and electoral analysis. You can find out more about my research [here](/research).

At present, I'm working as a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant at UCL. This semester I'm teaching on the POLS0008 Intro to Quantitative Research Methods course. I'm also hold two Research Officer posts here at Essex - one on a project for Filip Kostelka, and the other on a project for Royce Caroll. You can find more information about my work experience by checking out my [CV](/philswatton_cv.pdf).

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained my MSc Political Science here at Essex and my BA International Relations and Politics at Keele. During my time at Keele I gained a lot of practical work experience in politics, with work for the Labour Party during the 2017 general election and for a local MP as an intern during my third year.

In my spare time I've been teaching myself general programming. I began by learning frontend coding on freeCodeCamp. While I've yet to complete the certifications, this website is the result of everything I learned via FCC! I've also been persuing the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course. Since my research repositories are private, most of what you'll find on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philswatton) will be my solutions to these courses. The rest will be a combination of resources from smaller courses/tutorials and minor side-projects.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually either reading, binging netflix, or catching up with friends on Zoom. I generally go through phases with my reading and often enjoy history and fiction. My netflix habits are pretty unpredictable and range from watching the first episode of a show and forgotting to watch the rest to binging an entire show in a day.
