# About

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex. My supervisor is Rob Johns and my board members are Dominik Duell,Paul Whiteley, and Roi Zur. My thesis sits in the broad intersection between data science and public opinion. In particular, I work on empirical problems that arise from political beliefs, ranging from their measurement to their implications for elections. You can find out more about my research [here](/research).

At present, I hold two Research Officer posts here at Essex. The first is on a research project for Filip Kostelka. The second is on a project for Royce Caroll. I'm often in some teaching assistant position (always related to quantitative methods and data anlysis). I've previously taught for the Essex Summer School and UCL. You can find more information about my work experience by viewing my [CV](/philswatton_cv.pdf).

I'm from Wales and my secondary school was Ysgol Morgan Llwyd. I obtained my BA International Relations & Politics from Keele University (2015-2018). Along with my degree, I was awarded the Owen Powell student prize for outstanding achievement. While at Keele, I worked for the Labour Party as a Mobilisation Assistant during the 2017 General Election (working in Stoke) and later on for Gareth Snell MP as an employed intern. After Keele, I did my MSc Political Science (2018-2019) here at Essex.

Having initially learned Stata and R during my masters, I've since become increasingly passionate about programming in general; having initially failed to pursue a desire to learn prior to masters on a few occasions. To this end I've pursued various tutorials and courses online to teach myself general programming. I began by learning frontend coding on freeCodeCamp. While I have yet to complete the certifications, this website is the direct result of my interest in programming. Since then I have been persuing the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course.

Another interest of mine is reading. I particularly enjoy history - I suspect in no small part related to my enjoyment of Horrible Histories as a child! I also enjoy a good fiction book as much as anyone else. I was originally educated in Welsh and struggle to stay on top of the language and have since learned a little German at Essex, having developed a part-tiem fascination with German politics, history, and intellectuals while at Keele. I enjoy the occasional film or Netflix series, but am fairly unpredictable in the phases I go through with it.
