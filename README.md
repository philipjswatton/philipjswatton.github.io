This is the source code for my personal website, which can be found at [philswatton.github.io](https://philswatton.github.io).

## About this website

The primary purpose for this website is of course to assist with advertising myself and my work in the world of academia. However, it is also something of a personal project as I wrote much of the code for it myself - and it is in fact the first full website I've (mostly) coded myself rather than using a content management system such as WordPress. To that end it's both a space for me to try out new ideas and to improve my web development skills. Some details about this website include:

- It is hosted on [Github Pages]()
- Due to this it is powered by [Jekyll]()
- Unlike many other Jekyll-powered websites, it does not use a theme. This is essentially to provide myself with an opportunity to improve my CSS skills the hard way.
- Both the source code and further info on tutorials used to help me in putting this site together can be found in this Github repo
- Before deploying I often tinker with the CSS on [my codepen](https://codepen.io/phil-swatton). The lastest pen for this site's CSS can be found [here](https://codepen.io/phil-swatton/pen/MWyJNMy)

## Guides/Source code used

[This guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) was used to help me understand the process of setting up a site on Github pages with particular emphasis on file structure for Jekyll.

[This tutorial and code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp) was useful in giving me a basis to work from in creating the responsive CSS and javascript for the navbar.
