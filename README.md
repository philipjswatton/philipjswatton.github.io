# philswatton.github.io

This repo contains the code for my personal website, which can be found at [philswatton.github.io](https://philswatton.github.io).

## About the website

The website serves as a personal website for which the primary purpose is to advertise my academic work and experience. Its second purpose is to serve as an exercise in coding experience, so I aim to periodically either redo the site code or add new features. Over time I may add a blog section or begin listing some general programming projects along with my academic work on the website.

The current version was written from scratch in vscode. It uses Jekyll and SCSS, but does not use any frontend libraries.
