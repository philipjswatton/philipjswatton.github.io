# philswatton.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website, which can be found at [philswatton.github.io](https://philswatton.github.io).

## About this website

This website doubles up as a personal website for which the primary purpose is to advertise my academic work and experience and as an exercise in coding experience. Over time I may add a blog section or begin listing some coding projects along with my academic work on the website.

Before deploying I often tinker with the CSS on [my codepen](https://codepen.io/phil-swatton), where you'll also be able to find other frontend development projects (or learning attempts to be more accurate) of mine. The lastest pen for this site's CSS can be found [here](https://codepen.io/phil-swatton/pen/MWyJNMy).

## Guides/Source code used

[This guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) was used to help me understand the process of setting up a site on Github pages with particular emphasis on file structure for Jekyll.

[This tutorial and code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp) was useful in giving me a basis to work from in creating the responsive CSS and javascript for the navbar.

A list of 'typical' device breakpoints for responsive CSS media queries was [on this page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) was used in informing some of the CSS code for this page.
