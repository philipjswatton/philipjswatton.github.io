## psmisc

**psmisc** is an R package of miscellaneous functions primarily for use in political science research. It's available on my github at this link: [psmisc](https://github.com/philswatton/psmisc). It contains a small mix of functions that have related in some way to my work which I've written either for the sake of convienience or learning. So far, it contains an implementation Aldrich-McKelvey scaling, an implementation of Van der Ejik's Agreement measure, and an implementation of permutation testing.
