- name: Political Cleavages
  desc: An important strand in much of my thesis research is the role of political cleavages in public opinion and vote choice. It's widely recognised that there has been a long-term process of the class divide of social class being replaced by new social divides such as education and age. Similarly, there has been a related process of new ideological divides on non-economic dimensions becoming more salient. Many of my papers deal with aspects of this process, either directly or indirectly.
- name: Spatial Vote Choice
  desc: Related to the issue of new ideological dimensions becoming more salient is the issue of how these dimensions actually impact political beliefs in the first place. The spatial model of vote choice is a useful framework for studying the role of the new dimensions. I'm interested in how applications of the model help explain patterns of vote choice, and in exploring competing specifications of the model.
- name: Party Strategy
  desc: One research question I'm interested in is which levers political parties can pull to control their outcomes. It's reasonable to say that to a large extent many aspects of politics are beyond the control of most actors. Political outcomes are often substantially dictated by a combination of long-term factors and short-term events. I'm therefore pursuing research aimed at discovering how parties can actually manipulate their outcomes and what strategic decisions they should take.
