- name: Survey Comparability
  desc: Even in surveys with well-designed questions, the comparability of survey responses is threatened by a variety of factors. Differential item functioning, differential person functioning, and variation in substantive meaning over time and space all threaten valid inference. One strand of my research deals with this set of problems. In my methodological research, I review and develop methodologies to correct non-comparable responses. In my applied political science research, I use correction methods to facilitate comparability. All of my thesis papers broadly deal with this research strand.
- name: Ideal Point Estimation
  desc: A wide range of research applications in political science rely on accurate estimates of political positions on continuous dimensions. Ideal point estimation broadly is the set of methodologies used to extract these positions from various data sources. This is the second methodological strand in much of my research. Ideal point estimation represents in my view one of the most successful methodological developments in political science. DW-NOMINATE in particular is used by 538 to measure legislator positions in the US. There is substantial overlap between this research strand and the survey comparability strand, but ideal point estimation methods apply to a considerably wider range of data sources including parliamentary speech, roll call votes, tweets, and twitter followers.
- name: Small Area Estimation
  desc: While pursuing my PhD thesis I've developed an interest in estimating public opinion within small areas. In particular, I'm interested in the use of MRP to predict aggregate public opinion and electoral results. Going forward, I hope to spend more time working both on developing methodologies for small area estimation and on finding more applications beyond the current use cases.
