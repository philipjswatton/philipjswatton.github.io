<h2>Thesis</h2>
<p>My PhD thesis is on age divides in political behaviour and utilises age-period-cohort modeling. My interst in age as a key determinanet of voter choice was initially sparked during the 2016 EU referendum, in which I was one of many young voters on the losing side. Since then, events in the UK and abroad have confirmed the growing importance of age in voter behaviour. My research seeks to discover the driving forces underpinning this change. Thus far I have one working paper and one work in progress:</p>

<h3>Working papers:</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Work in progress:</h3>

	<li><strong>Name TBC:</strong> My second paper in the realm of APC research will perform an APC analysis on left-right identification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Research</h2>
<p>Beyond my thesis research, I also retain an interest in public opinion and quantitative research methods more widely. At present I have one working paper outside of the area of my thesis research.</p>

<h3>Working papers:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>These aren't the Measures you're Looking For: Acquiescence Bias in Measures of Political Beliefs:</strong> This paper begins by demonstrating the existence of a form of response bias known as 'acquiescence' bias (ARB) in several popularly used 'off the shelf' datasets. ARB represents a form of bias wherein survey respondents are more likely to 'agree' with statements regardless of their content. My paper demonstrates the research consequences of this; before offering a method to 'remove' ARB from two unbalanced Likert scales</li>
