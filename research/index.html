<h2>Thesis</h2>
<p>My PhD thesis is on age divides in political behaviour and utilises age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. My interst in age as a key determinanet of voter choice was initially sparked during the 2016 EU referendum, in which I was one of many young voters on the losing side. Since then, events in the UK and abroad have confirmed the growing importance of age in voter behaviour. My research seeks to discover the driving forces underpinning this change and to add to previous work in the realm of APC analysis. Thus far I have one working paper and am set to begin a second soon.</p>


<h2>Further Research Interests</h2>
<p>Beyond APC analysis, I am also broadly interested in both public opinion and quantitative research methods; and particularly their intersection. To this end, I'm also working on a project dealing with measurement of public opinion; and am intersted in the application of Factor Analysis and Multilevel Modelling in public opinion research.</p>


<h2>Current Research Projects</h2>
<p>Including those belonging to my PhD work, the projects I'm currently working are below. To divide between projects where I have a full draft version and projects where I do not, the former have been categorised as 'working papers' while the latter have been categorised as 'works in progress'.</p>
