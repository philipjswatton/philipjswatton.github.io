title: Hi there, I'm Phil Swatton!

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm Phil Swatton, a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex.</p>
<p>My research can be broadly split between the areas of public opinion and research methods for political science, though there is considerable overlap between the two. My thesis focuses on age differences in political behaviour, utilising age-period-cohort (APC) methods to achieve this. I have other ongoing research projects dealing with the measurement of public opinion and utilising MRP models (you might have read a bit about these during recent UK and US elections) to analyse UK general elections. You can find out more about my research and see a list of the papers I'm working on in the <a href="/research">research section</a> of my website.</p>
<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MSc Political Science at Essex and my BA International Relatons and Politics at Keele University. My interest in public opinion initially developed due to my involvement in the Labour Party, for which I worked as a Mobilisation Assistant in the Stoke-on-Trent Central Constituency during the 2017 UK General Election.</p>
<p>Outside of academia and politics, my main interests are programming, reading (usually history or fiction), and binging Netflix.</p>

<h2>CV</h2>
<p>I maintain two different versions of my CV: a version for academic job applications and a version for other job applications<strong>NOTE: Side is under construction - CVs to be added soon</strong></p>
<p>If you're interested in a full breakdown of my academic work and experience, you should read my <a href="">Academmic CV</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in my full working history and skillset, you should read my <a href ="">Professional CV</a>.</p>

<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>The primary purpose for this website is of course to assist with advertising myself and my work in the world of academia. However, it is also something of a personal project as I wrote much of the code for it myself - and it is in fact the first full website I've (mostly) coded myself rather than using a content management system such as WordPress. To that end it's both a space for me to try out new ideas and to improve my web development skills. Some details about this website include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
  <li>It is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li>The source code for this website (including links to the places where I try out new CSS before deploying it here), and further info on any tutorials/guides used to help me in putting this site together can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/philswatton/philswatton.github.io">Github repo</a></li>
  <li>Given the nature of this site as a personal project, it will probably be used to try out all sorts of minor experiments in frontend coding as I learn more. Make sure to check back occasionally!</li>
</ul>
