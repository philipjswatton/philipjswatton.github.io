<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm Phil Swatton, a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex.</p>

<p>My research can be broadly sumarrised in the areas of public opinion and quantitative research methods, with particular interest resting in their intersection. My thesis focuses on age differences in political behaviour, utilising age-period-cohort (APC) methods to achieve this. I have other ongoing research projects dealing with the measurement of public opinion and the 2019 UK General Election. You can find out more about my research and see a list of the resarch projects I'm currently working on in the <a href="/research">research section</a> of my website.</p>

<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MSc Political Science at Essex and my BA International Relatons and Politics at Keele University. My interest in public opinion initially developed due to my involvement in the Labour Party, for which I worked as a Mobilisation Assistant in the Stoke-on-Trent Central Constituency during the 2017 UK General Election.</p>

<p>Outside of academia and politics, one of my main interests are programming, reading (usually history or fiction), and binging Netflix shows.</p>
