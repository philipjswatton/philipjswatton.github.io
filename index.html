<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! I'm Phil Swatton, a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex.</p>

<p>My research can be broadly sumarrised in the areas of public opinion and quantitative research methods, with particular interest resting in their intersection. My thesis focuses on age differences in political behaviour, utilising age-period-cohort (APC) methods to achieve this. I have other ongoing research projects dealing with the measurement of public opinion and the 2019 UK General Election. You can find out more about my research and see a list of the resarch projects I'm currently working on in the <a href="/research">research section</a> of my website.</p>

<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MSc Political Science at Essex and my BA International Relatons and Politics at Keele University. My interest in public opinion initially developed due to my involvement in the Labour Party, for which I worked as a Mobilisation Assistant in the Stoke-on-Trent Central Constituency during the 2017 UK General Election.</p>

<p>Outside of academia and politics, one of my main interests is programming. I started learning to code during my Masters which in turn partially sparked a broader desire to start learning other languages. While I've always been intersted in programming, lockdown has given me an opportunity to pursue it futher. Because of this I've been working through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp's</a> certifications and auditing edX/Harvard's <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50 course</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond this, my other hobbies include reading (usually history or fiction) and binging Netflix shows.</p>

<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>The primary purpose for this website is of course to assist with advertising myself and my work in the world of academia. However, it is also something of a product of my longer-term interst in programming and a personal project as I wrote much of the code for it myself. It's the first (full) website I've (mostly) coded myself rather than using a content management system such as WordPress. To that end it represents both a space for me to try out new ideas/skills and an advert of what I've learned so far. Some fun facts about this website are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
  <li>Because of this it is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li>The source code for this website (including links to the places where I try out new CSS before deploying it here), and further info on any tutorials/guides used to help me in putting this site together can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/philswatton/philswatton.github.io">Github repo</a></li>
  <li>Given the nature of this site as a personal project, it will probably be used to try out all sorts of minor experiments in frontend coding as I learn more. Make sure to check back occasionally!</li>
</ul>
