This page contains a broad description of my research. If instead you'd like to see a complete list of the papers I've been working on, you can do so at my [papers](/publications) page. I'm always open to collaborations and questions so if you'd like to work with me or have questions about my own work, please feel free to get in touch.

## Latent Variable Models and Scaling Methods

Since starting my PhD, I have developed a keen interest in latent variable models and their uses for both measurement and exploratory research. In terms of the former, since 2019 I have been working on a paper dealing with the problem of acquiescence bias in Likert scales and how it can be corrected using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Going forward, I plan to follow this up with a paper on the specific implications acquiescence bias has had for some recent research in British political science.

More recently, I have taken an interest in perceptual data as measured by ordered rating scales. I have been using Aldrich-McKelvey (AM) scaling in my research for some time, but several recent papers have proposed more updated versions of it (or more precisely, of Bayesian AM scaling). I firmly believe that one of the most useful ways to conceptualise these models is as crowd-wisdom estimators/aggregators, as this allows for insighits from the world of forecasting to be adapted to our own challenges in estimating party positions (and voter positions) from this data. To this end I'm writing a paper adapting the Bias-Information-Noise model to this kind of data.

I am also in the process of contributing to some work for the 2021 Royal Statistical Society Conference with Royce Carroll, where we will be presenting work exploring the ideology and attitudes of the US public using data from the 2020 election. In this work we use a range of latent variable models and multidimensional scaling methods to explore the ideological and attitudinal landscape of the 2020 US election.

## Party Strategy

Having previously worked for the Labour Party, I retain a keen interest in party strategy. At present my interests are focussed on the spatial model of political competition but I hope at some point to broaden my interests to valence issues and how they compete with spatial issues. Since 2020 I have been working on a paper where I estimate the Labour Party's best possible EU Integration position in the 2019 general election, with the aim of discussing implications for its party strategy in the election.

## Voter Demographics

I have been fascinated in the role of voter demographics in shaping voter beliefs and behaviour for some time, having written both my undergraduate and masters disserations in this area. Since starting my PhD I have been working in particular on age-period-cohort (APC) models, in an attempt to better understand the role of age and generation in shaping political beliefs in the long term. I am particularly interested in the somewhat controversial hierarchical APC (HAPC) methodology, which uses cross-classified random effects to model the period and cohort components of APC.

I have also been working on a paper with Sarah Wagner where we aim to better deliniate the characteristics of education, taking Germany as a case study. Much past research has focused on a 'lower to higher' or 'non-grad vs grad' heuristics. We argue that it is necessary to better break down educational characteristics if we are to fully understand its role in shaping political attitudes and behaviours. 

## Misc

Beyond the above which summarises the main details of my research to date, I am passionate about statistics and computational social science. Beyond the methods explicitly mentioned above my skillset includes webscraping (having been a TA on the course at the Essex Summer School in 2020 and 2021), Bayesian statistics, random effects models (particularly 'hybrid' random effects models), and machine learning . In terms of the latter I'm particularly interested in the potential of 'cultural' aspects like cross-validation for more traditional applied research.
