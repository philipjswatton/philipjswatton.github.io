title: What Makes the British Party System Different?
tag: Political Science
---

Ideology is an attribute we associate with many actors and objects. Voters, politicians, political parties, and manifestos are all things which we consider to have, or express, ideology.

This basic fact raises all sorts of interesting theoretical and methodological questions. Do voters and politicians have the same ideologies? Should we expect manifesto ideology to reflect party ideology? How do we measure the ideology of politicians when they are incentivised by things like party discipline not to behave consistently with their ideology? How do we measure these different ideologies?

The answer to the last of these has been the source of substantial methodological innovation. For political parties, my focus here, there have been three main (and other less used) answers so far. The first of these is to take a 'crowd wisdom' approach and aggregate the views of voters collected in survey data. The second is to find a means of quantifying party manifestos, such as by econoding left-wing and right-wing statements. The third is to return to survye data, but this time to survey experts.

Surveying experts is the approach to measuring party positions taken by the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES)[^1]. There's good evidence from the CHES team that these measures are comparable on a cross-national basis[^2]. In other words, experts understand the main survey scales in the same way: there is a shared understanding of left-right and other scales. I would not be surprised if, over shorter time gaps, these measures are also comparable over time.

Because of this cross-sectional validity, the dataset is useful for making comparative inferences. In this particular case, I want to find out what stands out about British political parties on the most dimensions of party competition. To my mind, these dimensions are economics (left-right), European integration, immigration, and socio-cultural issues.

## Economic Left-Right

The grid of plots below is the first of four in this blog post, all of them in the same format. On the y-axis of each plot are seven of the biggest party families in European politics. These are the radical left, socialist parties, green parties, liberal parties, christian democratic parties, conservative parties, and the radical right.

On the x-axis is the party's position on the economic left-right dimension. This is computed by surveying experts on the parties in each country, and then aggregating their placements of the party. Because the survey scale goes from 0 (left) to 10 (right), the range of the scale is from 0 to 10.

Each point on the plot represents a single political party. Parties in other West European countries are circles and are semi-translucent. British parties are triangles and are fully opaque. The mean position of other West European parties is presented as a fully opaque square. Each plot in the grid represents one survey year for CHES.

The British parties are Labour for the social democrats, the Liberal Demorats for the liberals, the Green Party for the greens, the Conservatives for the Cosnervtives, UKIP from 1999 to 2014 for the radical right, and the Brexit Party in 2019 for the radical right. There is no data for the Greens or for UKIP in 2002 and so these parties are not plotted for this year.

Probably the first comment worth making, implicit in the list of British parties above, is which parties Britain *doesn't* have. There is no meaningful radical left or christian democratic party in the UK. That there is no christian democratic party makes sense - these parties emerged as parties of the mainstream right in European countries with large Catholic populations after the second world war[^3]. The role of mainstream centre-right party is taken by the Conservatives in the UK.

Perhaps surprising at first glance is the absence of a radical left party. Of course, Britain has not really had a meaningful far left party since the collapse of the CPGB's support base. The last election in which it won seats was in 1945. Even in this election it won only 2 seats (its best ever performance), and this a smattering similar to other minor groupings such as various flavours of independent candidate (usually 1 or 2 for each flavour), the Independent Labour Party (3), and the Common Wealth Party (1).

Another way in which this becomes less surprising however is that once we look at the plot, across all survey years the Green Party is among the most economically left-wing of its party family. Given the centrality of left-wing economics to traditional radical left parties, there is little space for a radical left party to make a breakthrough at the moment. Left-wing voters are well-served by the Greens.

The Liberal Democrats are also among the most left-wing of their party family, something which held true even in the Clegg years. This is not to say it is particularly left-wing, only that it is more so than other West European liberal parties. The Labour party's shifts map on easily to different periods of leadership. One of the most right-wing social democratic parties under Blair, then a shift towards mainstream social democracy under Brown and Miliband, and finally a shift towards looking more like a radical left party under Corbyn.

The Conservatives, by contrast, are more in line with their party family. It is however worth noting that their family is itself on average more right-wing than the Christian Democratic family (though not drastically so). The radical right is an idiosyncratic family on economics, but the British radical right sits at the more right-wing end of the economic spectrum.

British party politics is therefore strange in a few ways on economics. Many of our parties tend to be at the more extreme ends of the ideological agendas of their respective party families. Labour experienced a fairly drastic shift from Blair to Corbyn, and it will be interesting to see where experts place it under Starmer. The Greens look more like a radical left party in their economic position, while the Liberal Democrats often look more like a green or social democratic party.

## Europe

The next dimension I looked at is orientations on Europe. Here, the scale ranges from 1 (support EU integration) to 7 (oppose EU integration). This reverses the original order in the data so that the 'left' on the x-axis is always the currently left-coded position. The plot is otherwise the same as before.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-01-25/eu.png" alt="Grid of plots showing party postions on Europe." class="blog-img">

One of the interesting things emerging from this plot is which parties have changed their positions over time, largely due to Brexit, and which have not. The Labour Party has consinstently been more Eurosceptic than other social democratic parties - but this increased dramatically in 2019. It is likely that this will be higher again in the upcoming 2024 CHES data.

The Greens show the most drastic pattern of shifts. In 2006 they shifted towards Euroscepticism - looking fully like a radical left party at this stage. As we shall see, alongside far-left economic policies Euroscepticism is the main dimension which distinguishes radical left parties from social democratic parties. The Greens however shifted back towards being pro-European integration, and in 2019 became as strongly pro-integration as the Liberal Democrats, who have been consistently pro-integration over time.

On the mainstream right, the Conservatives are notable for their Euroscepticism. It's on this point one wonders about the over-time comparability of the data: was the Conservative party in 2010 *really* so close in Europscepticism to itself under May or Johnson in 2019? One wonders whether Brexit has affected expert understanding of the Eurosceptic end of the scale in the UK. And of course: UKIP and the Brexit Party are heavily anti-integration, although the Brexit Party's position strikes me as an underestimate.

Brexit has therefore made the British party system stand out on European integration. Britain always had a Eurosceptic rightwing to a degree unseen in other countries, and Labour had always been among the least enthusiastic for integration among social democratic parties. However, the politics of Brexit in 2019 shifted Labour while making the Greens among the most pro-integration in Western Europe.

## Immigration

Closely related to European integration is party positions on immigration. Here we return to a 0 (pro-immigration) to 10 (anti-immigration) scale. This plot contains less survey years as the question was only asked from 2006 onwards.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-01-25/immigration.png" alt="Grid of plots showing party postions on Europe." class="blog-img">

Until Corbyn's leadership, the Labour Party had generally been one of the more anti-immigraiton among social democratic parties. I was somewhat surprised to see this - what you typically hear about the Blair governments now is generally decisions such as allowing new Eastern European EU citizens to migrate immediately following the 2004 expansion of the EU. But then one only needs to think of the treatment of the Ghurkas to realise that one decision does not an overall position make.

The Greens are fairly standard for their family in being consistently pro-immigration. The liberal party family is fairly idiosyncratic on immigration, but the Liberal Democrats, consistent with being among the more left-leaning members of this family, are among the pro-immigration liberal parties. The Conservatives, UKIP, and Brexit Party in the meantime 

Immigraiton, excepting the Labour party under Blair, Brown, and Miliband, is one of the less interesting dimensions insofar as British parties are considered. Here, unlike on economics and EU integration, they are typically in line with other West European parties of their type.


## Socio-Cultural Issues

Finally, I will discuss the positions of the parties on socio-cultural issues. In CHES, this is measured using something called the GAL-TAN dimension, which stands for Green-Alternative-Libertarian versus Traditionalist-Authoritarian-Nationalist, which is well-known in the literature on parties. It more or less captures what it sounds like. GAL is at 0, and TAN is at 10.

<img src="/assets/images/blog/2025-01-25/gal-tan.png" alt="Grid of plots showing party postions on the GAL-TAN dimension." class="blog-img">

As with immigration, the British parties show less interesting patterns than they do on other dimensions. British parties are generally more or less in line with their families. Labour under Blair was more centrist on this dimension than other social democratic parties, but was not as divergent as on other dimensions. The Liberal Democrats again are more left - or liberal - than other liberal parties. But the clear picture emerging is that what makes Briitsh party competition distinctive is economics and EU integration.
